# Basic-Blockchain
A lightweight blockchain implementation written in C++ to demonstrate the core concepts of blockchain technology â€” including block creation, SHA-256 hashing, linking blocks via previous hashes, and verifying chain integrity.
Features

Genesis block creation

Adding and linking new blocks

SHA-256 hashing (self-implemented)

Chain verification and tampering detection

Simple console-based interface





 Technologies Used

C++ Language (object-oriented implementation)

SHA-256 (for cryptographic hashing)





 Learning Outcomes

Understand how blocks are chained using hashes

Learn about the genesis block and data immutability.

Get a hands-on intro to how real blockchain systems like Bitcoin are built at a basic level





How to Run

g++ -o blockchain_cpp blockchain.cpp
./blockchain_cpp
